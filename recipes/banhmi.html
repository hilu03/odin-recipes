  <h1>Bánh Mì (Vietnamese sandwich)</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Bánh Mì is a Vietnamese sandwich that's made up of an odd sounding combination - crusty bread rolls smeared with pate, mayo, suspicious looking Asian ham, pickled vegetables, green onion, coriander/cilantro, a mighty wack of fresh chillies and drizzle of seasoning.
  </p>
  <p>
    It tastes like a rich ham sandwich with a hit of Asian freshness. It's a sensation of flavours and textures that's generated a cult following all around the world. The most sought after Bánh Mì vendors have lengthy queues from early morning - both here and in Vietnam!
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Vietnamese cold cuts - </strong>or Vietnamese meatballs or chicken.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Very crusty baguettes - </strong> just really good, normal bread rolls. Crusty on the outside, soft on the inside! When you cut the baguette open, the crust should literally crumble everywhere and make a total mess!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pate -</strong> pork or chicken, the very best Bánh Mì vendors make their own. Any normal pate that's not heavily flavoured with liquor or a flavouring like orange is just fine.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mayo - </strong> mayo + pate creates a unique juiciness and savoury richness that we know and love about Bánh Mì!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Pickled carrot - </strong> simple to make, the soft crunch and tartness is such a great contrast to the other textures and flavours
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cucumber, coriander/cilantro, green onion, chilli - </strong>he freshness and spiciness that we know and love about Bánh Mì!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Maggi Seasoning - </strong>or just soy sauce. Just a little drizzle to finish it off!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Split the roll down the top middle (not along the side like you'd normally do).</li>
    <li>Smear with pate then mayo on one side (both if you're feeling super indulgent).</li>
    <li>Jam in the ham, cucumber strips, carrot, green onion, then lastly coriander/cilantro.</li>
    <li>Finish with a sprinkle of chilli and a little sprinkle of Maggi Seasoning (about 1/2 tsp).</li>
  </ol>
